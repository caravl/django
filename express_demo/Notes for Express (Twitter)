npm installation
  shown under dependencies in package.json
  "scripts"
    "start" = "nodemon app.js" --- run npm start in terminal will populate
    "test" --- run npm test in terminal

res redirect
  when a request comes in, redirect person to another page
  without a redirect, browser would hang
  cant use res.redirect and res.send in the same get

using jQuery to add new tweets to DOM vs using templating?
  nunjucks cant dynamically update the page after its been loaded, so we need somethiing like jQuery for it

how to keep track of whats passing where to where
  is it client side or server side -- all node command is server side, all javascript or html is client side

  res.render took in some data from server and being populated to client side

  req.params (client input to server side)

  form (client input to server)

app is the name pipeline
  app.listen
  app.use
  other app. methods


middleware the function passed into methods like app.use or app.get
  a callback function that does an extra step that doesn't necessarily return anything, looking for other methods that match AFTER it

next()
  to use next, must pass it in the callback function


router vs app
  router is a mini app that we've passed to express
  to organize a group of specific route in a mini app
  each router dealing with user requests, requests for tweets

sockets.io
  why are are we passing along io to router-returning function
  not part of


node
express
sql
react


layout.html is basic structure of page
index.html is the body of the page where js is implemented (?)



QUESTIONS
- memorize syntax???
- what does each module do? it's part of the whole?
- what does nunjucks / module.exports / lodash / sockets.io / next() / action verbs and their definitions?
- what is the difference between npm install morgan and npm morgan --save
- res.render takes first parameter of the page we're rendering, and second parameter of what we're passing into that page
