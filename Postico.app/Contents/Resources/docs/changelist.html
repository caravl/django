		<h2>Postico v1.2</h2>
		<h3>New Features</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<b>Keep Connection Alive</b>: Postico now periodically sends a command to the server to ensure that the connection isn't terminated by a firewall or similar.
				This setting replaces the "Disconnect Automatically" function, which did not work reliably when using temp tables or changing settings like the search path.
				<a href="https://github.com/jakob/Postico/issues/310">#310</a>
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Restore session settings</b>: Postico now remembers session settings (like time zone, datestyle, search path) and restores them after reconnecting when the connection was lost.
			</li>
			<li>
				The new <b>SQL Preview button for filters</b> lets you display the SQL generated by Postico
				<a href="https://github.com/jakob/Postico/issues/61">#61</a>
			</li>
			<li>
				Postico now displays partitioned tables (introduced in PostgreSQL 10)
			</li>
			<li>

				<a href="https://github.com/jakob/Postico/issues/382">#382</a>
			</li>
			<li>
				Switch between tabs with ⌘1 to ⌘9
				<a href="https://github.com/jakob/Postico/issues/391">#391</a>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Improvements</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
				I added an "is distinct from" filter, and removed "is not exactly" to avoid confusion.
				The difference is that the former includes NULL values while the latter does not.
				<a href="https://github.com/jakob/Postico/issues/368">#368</a>
			</li>
			<li>
				Filters with blank fields are now ignored.
				There is now a new filter that searches for empty strings.
				<a href="https://github.com/jakob/Postico/issues/330">#330</a>
			</li>
			<li>
				Made row count &amp; elapsed time selectable
				<a href="https://github.com/jakob/Postico/issues/334">#334</a>
			</li>
			<li>
				Added keyboard shortcuts for changing the font size (⌘+ and ⌘-)
				<a href="https://github.com/jakob/Postico/issues/335">#335</a>
			</li>
			<li>
				More consistent handling of the ESC key:
				<ul>
					<li>ESC now means "Revert Changes" in most text fields</li>
					<li>ESC no longer triggers System Autocomplete <a href="https://github.com/jakob/Postico/issues/379">#379</a></li>
					<li>ESC dismisses the filter bar &amp; page selector</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				Reloading no longer collapses schemas
				<a href="https://github.com/jakob/Postico/issues/102">#102</a>
			</li>
			<li>
				⌘↩ now applies filters in the table view
				<a href="https://github.com/jakob/Postico/issues/313">#313</a>
			</li>
			<li>
				Foreign keys are now editable
				<a href="https://github.com/jakob/Postico/issues/264">#264</a>
			</li>
			<li>
				Made it more obvious how to activate Postico. All nag dialogs now have an "Activate License…" button, and I've added an "Activate License…" menu item to the help menu.
				<a href="https://github.com/jakob/Postico/issues/404">#404</a>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Bugfixes</h3>

				<a href="https://github.com/jakob/Postico/issues/289">#289</a>

			</li>
		</ul>
	
		<p class=date>Nov 23, 2015</p>
		<h2>Postico v1.0.1</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Added an option in preferences to change the font size of the SQL Query text view <a href="https://github.com/jakob/Postico/issues/38">#38</a>
			</li>
			<li>
				The interface now refreshes correctly after deleting the last index.
			</li>
			<li>
				The SQL Query View now recognises statements containing semicolons <a href="https://github.com/jakob/Postico/issues/109">#109</a>
			</li>
			<li>
				Fixed a bug where the execute button was enabled even though there was no query on the line.
			</li>
			<li>
				Postico now correctly handles special characters in filenames (like /) when exporting.
			</li>
			<li>
				When saving changes to a table, you now have the option to commit changes even when the number 
				of affected rows does not match what Postico expected <a href="https://github.com/jakob/Postico/issues/130">#130</a>
				<p>
				You can now also disable the check altogether with a hidden preference:
				<br><tt>defaults write at.eggerapps.Postico IgnoreAffectedRows 1</tt>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
				Postico now automatically replaces non-standard space and newline characters in the SQL query view, and it strips byte order marks.
				<a href="https://github.com/jakob/Postico/issues/75">#75</a> <a href="https://github.com/jakob/Postico/issues/84">#84</a>
				<p>
				You can disable this behaviour with a hidden preference:
				<br><tt>defaults write at.eggerapps.Postico SanitizeWhitespace 0</tt>
				
			</li>
			<li>
				Added a "Copy with Header" command <a href="https://github.com/jakob/Postico/issues/65">#65</a> <a href="https://github.com/jakob/Postico/issues/125">#125</a>

		<p class=date>Nov 4, 2015</p>
		<h2>Postico v1.0</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<b>Indexes:</b>
				Postico now displays table indexes in the table structure view right below the columns.
				This feature is currently mainly useful for informative purposes:
				it's convenient to get a quick overview. You can also rename indexes, add comments, or delete indexes.
				However, there is no graphical user interface yet for creating indexes (I will add that in a future version)				
				<a href="https://github.com/jakob/Postico/issues/19">#19</a>
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Avoid lost connections:</b>
				Postico now automatically disconnects from the server before your Mac goes to sleep,
				or when the connection was idle for 5 minutes.
				Postico reconnects automatically the next time you try to execute a query.
				This should hopefully fix the problem of lost connections when servers are configured with a timeout.
				You can disable the idle timeout in preferences.
				<a href="https://github.com/jakob/Postico/issues/66">#66</a>
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Typography:</b>
				Postico now uses Apple's new system font San Francisco everywhere (except for SQL which is shown in Menlo).
				I also switched back to fixed width digits for better legibility of tabular data.
				Additionally, numeric columns are now right-aligned.
				I've also tweaked all the margins since the different x-height of the new font requires slightly different alignment occasionally.
			</li>
			<li>
				PostGIS geometry and geography columns are now displayed as EWKT, which is slightly more readable than the default binary gibberish <a href="https://github.com/jakob/Postico/issues/92">#92</a>
			</li>
			<li>
				Deleting a table that hasn't been saved yet no longer shows an error message and works as expected.
			</li>
			<li>
				I added a context menu for table column headers in the SQL Query view <a href="https://github.com/jakob/Postico/issues/97">#97</a>
			</li>
			<li>
				Fixed a deadlock (beachball) in the syntax highlighter <a href="https://github.com/jakob/Postico/issues/108">#108</a>
			</li>
			<li>
				When using the "Copy As Insert" command, Postico now separates rows with newlines <a href="https://github.com/jakob/Postico/issues/104">#104</a>
			</li>
			<li>
				Redesigned foreign key fields in the sidebar for a more consistent look and feel.
			</li>
			<li>
				The sidebar now displays column types.
			</li>
			<li>
				The tables in the popup menu for foreign keys are now sorted again <a href="https://github.com/jakob/Postico/issues/85">#85</a>
			</li>
			<li>
				The query history popover lets you now insert queries by double clicking or pressing enter <a href="https://github.com/jakob/Postico/issues/101">#101</a>
			</li>
		</ul>

		<p class=date>October 9, 2015</p>
		<h2>Postico v0.28</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>
				You can now execute all queries with the keyboard command ⌥⌘↩
				 (behavior similar to Postico before version 0.27)
			</li>
			<li>
				Fixed an issue where the Execute button became disabled (eg. after hitting ⌘A)
			</li>
			<li>
				Fixed an issue where typing ⌘/ to uncomment lines didn't work
			</li>
		</ul>

		<p class=date>October 8, 2015</p>
		<h2>Postico v0.27</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<b>System requirements raised to OS X 10.9.</b>
				Postico wasn't as stable on 10.8 as I wanted it to be.
				Working around bugs in Mountain Lion and additional QA efforts for the legacy system would have required too much time that I'd rather spend on new features, considering the very low number of users.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Improved error handling during connection establishment.</b>
				Postico was unreliable when restoring previously open windows in certain conditions.
				Problems occurred when the server did not support SSL, or when the SSH server required keyboard-interactive authentication.
				Connection establishment should now be much more reliable. Also, certificate warnings are now shown only once.
				<a href="https://github.com/jakob/Postico/issues/81">#81</a>
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>“Execute” (Cmd-Return) now executes only the current query</b> <a href="https://github.com/jakob/Postico/issues/11">#11</a>

			</li>
			<li>

			</li>
			<li>

			<li>
				Improved button styling in SQL Query view in Yosemite (eg. cancel button is now visibly disabled).
			</li>
			<li>
				Fixed display issues on El Capitan.
			</li>
			<li>
				Postico now ignores unsupported SSH host key types in known_hosts <a href="https://github.com/jakob/Postico/issues/78">#78</a>

		<h2>Postico – changes from PG Commander</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<b>All new design — optimized for Yosemite</b><br>
				I have simplified and completely redesigned PG Commander to take full advantage of Yosemite's new design language.
				The new design degrades gracefully and also looks great on older versions of OS X.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Table Structure Editor</b><br>
				The most requested feature in PG Commander is finally here!
				<ul>
					<li>Rename tables, change schema, change tablespace</li>
					<li>Rename columns, add columns, remove columns</li>
					<li>Change column type and default value</li>
					<li>Add &amp; remove column constraints (Primary Key, Unique, Check, Not Null, Foreign Key)</li>
					<li>Add comments to tables, columns, and individual constraints</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Table Contents View</b><br>
				<ul>
					<li>Inline Editor: double click cell to edit</li>
					<li>Batch editing: insert, update, delete multiple rows in a single transaction</li>
					<li>Update views</li>
					<li>Sanity check: PG Commander checks the number of affected rows before committing</li>
					<li>Row detail view now in the sidebar</li>
					<li>Update many rows at once with the sidebar</li>
					<li>Vastly improved scrolling performance</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>SQL Query View</b><br>
				I have completely replaced the SQL Terminal with the all new SQL Query View inspired by Sequel Pro.
				I thought that the SQL terminal was a good idea, but it had a lot of usability issues.
				For example, a common complaint from customers was that controls moved around.
				Also, the terminal had unfixable performance issues.
				<ul>
					<li>All new design &amp; improved performance</li>
					<li>Support for large results (more than a million rows)</li>
					<li>Support for long SQL queries (100.000 lines or more)</li>
					<li><b>Query history popup</b>: browse recent queries, clear individual queries from history</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Status Display</b><br>
				There is now a status display in the title bar.
				It shows what query is currently executing.
				When idle, it shows which database you are connected to, and the server version.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Cancel command</b><br>
				The keyboard shortcut ⌘. now aborts the current query.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Improved Reload behavior</b><br>
				Cached data is now purged more reliably when reloading.
				The terminal is no longer cleared when you reload.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Improved change tracking</b><br>
				PG Commander is now more reliable when you navigate away from a view with unsaved changes, eg. when using the back button.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>New Sidebar Icons</b><br>
				Updated to a flatter look. Schemas now have a folder icon.
			</li>
			<li>
				Table column titles now span multiple lines when there isn't enough space to show them in a single line
			</li>
			<li>
				Added a preference to require confirmation before connecting to SSL servers with valid, but unknown certificates
			</li>
			<li>
				Added a command to truncate tables.
			</li>
		</ul>
